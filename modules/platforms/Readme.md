# About Platforms
> On mobile platforms and process


The platforms we work on as developers are broad with many areas to specialise in. People with a specialisation in one area but generalisation in others are valuable experts in a team, such that they even have their own name, [T-shaped professionals](https://agileleanlife.com/t-shaped-skills-every-area-life/). You could choose to specialise in a language, such as Kotlin or Objective-C, a specific technology, or a broader area such as data persistence. Find a resource (e.g. online course, book, etc) which allows you to explore and specialise in one of these new areas. A typical course could be any of those available on Udacity or Ray Wenderlich. It doesn’t have to be a simple course, or teach the basics, but it should be interesting and teach you something new about your development platform.

Open feedback is an important part of being a developer at Novoda. As you specialise in one area your colleagues specialise in another, both of you can collaborate together to come up with solutions that work well under different cases. From pair-programming to code reviews, making your work easily accessible and reviewable ultimately makes the product you’re working on better. 

Part of a good feedback culture is making giving feedback as easy and stress-free as possible. Tools such as pull requests can be used to make your intention clear to someone who is reviewing your code in order to improve it. By using consistent pull request templates, you can give enough information to a reviewer, and can be encouraged to answer questions proactively. Likewise, maintaining a consistent coding style guide allows reviewers to concentrate on the broad strokes of the code more than formatting, which often comes across as pedantic. By ensuring your code conforms to the formatting, you make the review less about nit-picking and more useful and informative to both the reviewer and the reviewee.

## Guidelines

Some guidelines for making the most of feedback and learning in this part of the NCU include: 

- Make a small project or pull request against an existing project, showcasing what you have learnt in this module
- Your colleagues should have easy access to your work: prefer to have your project on a hosted repo, for example Github or BitBucket. 
- Ensure someone viewing your project can easily understand what you’re trying to achieve: document your goal as part of your work
- The code should look familiar to your reviewers: ensure you follow Novoda’s style guidelines (see [novoda/styles-guides](https://github.com/novoda/novoda/tree/master/style-guides)).
- Progress should be iterative and well documented: you should issue at least one PR that someone else should review.
- You should share back what you learned: you can pick a format between a Hack & Tell, blog post, kata, or workshop.

Remember, your buddy can always help you with any of the points above.
