> A miserable job is different from bad one. Bad or good depends upon who you are and what you value and enjoy. A miserable job is one that you dread going to and can’t wait to leave. (Patrick M. Lencioni)

To be a successul manager involves servant-leadership, encouraging others to always be better, to listen to people and point out what they are doing right whilst supporting them if they feel they got something wrong.

> Flat hierarchies require strong leadership

Novoda's hierarchy has been historically very flat, meaning management is never about building a pyramid of power, its about 1on1 conversations, enabling individuals to see where they are and where they are going. To help those around you enjoy the journey and be the best employee they can. 

Management is a very important responsibility, you should be proud to call yourself a Manager at Novoda and excited about the possibilities of what you can achieve.

## Literature

> Research indicates that workers have three prime needs: Interesting work, recognition for doing a good job, and being let in on things that are going on in the company.

Read both of these:

* **The Truth About Employee Engagement: Addressing the Three Root Causes of Job Misery** by Patrick M. Lencioni
* **The New One Minute Manager** by Spencer Johnson

Further optional learning:

* **Radical Candor: How to Get What You Want by Saying What You Mean** by Kim Scott

## Guidelines

> To win in the marketplace you must first win in the workplace.

Some guidelines for making the most of feedback and learning in this part of the NCU include: 

* Both books are available as audio as well as written. It's recommended you listen to the audio book to make the most of a commute, but keep a written copy for future reference. 
* Ensure your Manager or your Reports know what you’re trying to achieve: document your goal as part of your work.
* Progress should be iterative and well documented: keep sticky notes in the book, or digital notes to reference later
* You should share back what you learned: you can pick a format between, 1on1 discussions, a Hack & Tell, blog post, kata, or workshop.
